### Pairwise Checks
For the analysis, please check the **`notebooks/`** folder and open the **pairwise analysis** subfolder.  
There are several notebooks that load the dataframes and show quick findings for each circuit family.

Each dataframe shown in the notebooks corresponds to the CSV files located under  
**`results/pairwise/summary/`**.
